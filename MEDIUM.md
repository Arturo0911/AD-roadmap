# Active Directory RoadÂ Map.


Here I want to share the whole path I had to learn how to improve the security in Active Directory environments. In most cases, I will use Hack The Box retired machines, specially the Windows Machines.


## 1 What is Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows networks environments, specially enterprise environments. It is a distributed, hierachical structure that allosw for centrilezed
management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, 
devices, and trusts.


## 2 Information Security in Active Directory (AD).

AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain enviroment. It has come under increasing attack in recent years. It is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default", and it can be easily
misconfigure. This warkness can be leveraged to move laterally and 
vertically within a network and gain unauthorized access.


## 3. Common protocols, ports and usage in Active Directory environment.


### 3.1 Kerberos

Kerberos is an open standard and allows interoperability with other systems that use the same standard. When a user logs into their PC,
Kerberos is used to authenticate them through mutual authentication, or both the user and the server verify their identity. Kerberos is a stateless authentication protocol based on tickets instead of transmitting user passwords over the network. As part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), domain controllers have a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) that issues tickets. When a user initiates a login request to a system, the client they are using to authenticate requests a ticket from the KDC, encrypting the request with the user's password. If the KDC can decrypt the request (AS-REQ) using its password, it will create a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and transmit it to the user. The user then presents their TGT to a domain controller to request a ticket from the Ticketing Service (TGS), encrypted with the associated services' NTLM (Local New Technology Manager) password hash. Finally, the client requests access to the required service by presenting the TGS to the application or service, which decrypts it with its password hash. If the entire process is completed successfully, the user will be allowed to access the requested service or application.



Kerberos authentication effectively decouples user's credentials from their requests to
consumable resources, ensuring thata their password isn't transmited over the network (i.e., accessing an internal SharePoint intranet site). The Kerberos Key Distribution Centre (KDC) does not reecord previous transactions. Instead, the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service ticket (TGS) relies on a valid Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). It assumes that if the user has a valid TGT, they must have proven their identity.

### 3.2 DNS

Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) uses DNS to allow clients (workstations,
servers, and other system that communicate with the domain) to lcoate Domain
Controllers and for Domain Controllers that host the directory service to communicate
amongst themselves. DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and is broadly 
used to across internal networks and the internet. Private internal networks user Actve
Directory DNS namespaces to facilitate communications between servers, clients, and
peers. AD mainains a database of services running on the network in the form of
service records (SRV). These service records allow clients in an AD environment to
locate services that they need, such as a file server, printer, or Domain Controller.
Dynamic DNS is used to make changes in the DNS database automatically should a 
system's IP address change. Making these entries manually would be very time-
cosuming and leave room for error. If the DNS database does not have the correct IP
address for a host, clients will not be able to locate and communicate with it on the 
network. When a client joins the network, it locates the Domain Controller by sending 
a query to the DNS service, retrieving an SRV record from the DNS database, and
transmitting the Domain Controller's hostname to the client. The client then uses this 
hostname to obtain the IP address of the Domain Controller. DNS uses TCP and UDP
port 53. UDP port 53 is the default, but it falls back to TCP when no longer able to
communicate and DNS messages are larger thatn 512 bytes.

### 3.3 LDAP

Active Directory supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for directory
lookups. LDAP is an open-source and cross-platform protocol used for authentication 
agains various directory services (such as AD). The latest LDAP specification is
Version 2, publicshed as RFC 4511. A firm understanding of how LDAP works in an AD
environment is crucial for attackers and defenders. LDAP us port 389, and LDAP
over SSL (LDAPS) communicates over port 636.


AD stores user account information and security information such as passwords and
facilitates sharing this information with other devices on the network. LDAP is the 
language that applications use to communicate with other servers that provide
 directory services. In other words, LDAP is how systems in the network environment
 can "speak" to AD.




LDAP is a protocol used to access and manage directory services. In the case of Active Directory, LDAP is the primary protocol used to interact with the directory service. Active Directory is a centralized database that stores information about network resources, such as user accounts, groups, computers, and other network devices.


Structure: Active Directory organizes information in a hierarchical structure called the directory information tree (DIT). The DIT is composed of objects, such as users, groups, and organizational units (OUs). Each object has attributes that store specific information about it, like a user's name or email address.

LDAP Operations: LDAP defines a set of operations that can be performed on the directory. These operations include searching for objects, adding new objects, modifying existing objects, and deleting objects. LDAP uses a query language called the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) to specify these operations.

Authentication and Authorization: LDAP is commonly used for user authentication and authorization in Active Directory. When a user logs in to a system, their credentials are sent to the Active Directory server over LDAP to verify their identity. Once authenticated, the user's access rights and permissions can be determined using LDAP queries.

Port and Protocol: LDAP typically uses TCP/IP as the underlying network protocol and operates on port 389. However, in the case of Active Directory, the LDAP service is integrated with the Kerberos authentication protocol, and LDAP traffic is often encrypted using SSL/TLS. In this case, LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS) is used, and it operates on port 636.

Integration with Applications: LDAP is widely supported by various applications and services. It allows these applications to access and retrieve information from Active Directory, enabling features like user authentication, address book lookups, and access to shared resources.
