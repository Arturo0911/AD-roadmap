# Active Directory CheatSheet

### What I want to learn from this path.

    - Understand how kerberos and Kerbrute works!



### SMB service
-   using smbmap we can get the shares
    
    ```bash
    smbmap -H <host> -u 'null'
    # to perform the null session 
    ```


-   using smbclient

    ```bash
    smbclient -L //<host>/Shares -N
    # with -N we perform a null session

    smbclient //<host>/Shares -N
    # to connect without listing the shares
    ```
    

### LAPS
Local Administrator Password Solution. Is used to manage local account
passwords of Active Directory computers.




### LDAP (Lightweight directory access protocol)
Is a protocol that makes it possible for applications to query
user information rapidly.


the port fort ldap 389


Someone within your office wants to do two things: Send email to a
recent hire and print a copy of that conversation on a new printer.
LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol) makes both of those steps possible.

Set it up properly, and that employee doesn't need to talk with IT
to complete the tasks.


### What is LDAP?

Companies store usernames, passwords, email addresses, printers
connections, and other static data within directories. LDAP is an
open, vendor-natural application protocol for accessing and main-
taining that data. LDAP can also trackle authentication, so users can sign
on just once and access many different files on the server.

```bash
# user enumeration for ldap protocol 389

/opt/windapsearch.py -d <domain> --dc-ip <ip address>


GetADUsers.py -d <domain>/ -dc-ip <ip address> -debug
```


### Kerberos


With a several names, we get using user-anarchy, possible
usernames

and perform a kerbrute attack

```bash
kerbrute userenum -d <domain> --dc <ip address> user-list.txt
```

with this tool if there are any valid user in the user-list.txt
we get a hash referring to a Ticket Granted Ticket

```bash
‚ùØ /opt/kerbrute  userenum -d <domain name "commonly .local or .htb"> --dc <ip address domain controller> unames.txt

    __             __               __

The code above it's an example of how can i do to get the TGT from kerbrute and
after that I cracked it and i get the password for the user fsmith and
connect it with evil-winrm


Inside the Powershell console, I started enumerating information

```powershell
net user <user>

# to get the ptivilege information about that user
whoami /priv

# to find any other resurce inside the Powershell I use

Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Users\<User>" -Filter "name of file" -Recurse
```

## Further information

Using Winpeas.exe and updload it from the attack machine by evil-winrm
and get the information using evil-winrm

### Getting information using the Winpeas.exe
